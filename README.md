With your raspberry pi pico, plug it into your computer. Then drag "flashnuke.uf2" on to the pico drive. It will disappear for a moment and then re-appear.
After it reappears, drag the "adafruit" file onto the drive, it will onece again disappear for a moment and reappear. This time it should reappear as "CIRCUIPY"
Now, take the files from "Pico_Ducky" and extract them, then paste them onto the pico drive!
If for some reason it does not work, it is most likely just out of date.
